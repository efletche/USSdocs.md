# Units Of Measure

The normal units of measure used in the [data file](datafile-format.md) are as follows:

* Catch biomass - *metric tons*

* Body weight – *kilograms*

* Body length – usually in *cm*, weight at length parameters must correspond to the units of body length and body weight.

* Survey abundance – any units if **q** is freely scaled; *metric tons* or *thousands of fish* if **q** has a quantitative interpretation

* Output biomass – *metric tons*

* Numbers – *thousands of fish*, because catch is in metric tons and body weight is in kg

* Spawning biomass – *metric tons of mature females* if eggs/kg = 1 for all weights; otherwise has units that are proportional to egg production.
