#Introduction

This manual provides a guide for using the stock assessment program, Stock Synthesis (SS).  The guide contains a description of the input and output files and usage instructions. A technical description of the model itself is in Methot and Wetzel (2013).  SS is programmed using Auto Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB; Fournier 2001.  ADMB is now available at admb-project.org).  SS currently is compiled using ADMB version 11.1 using the Microsoft C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 16.0.  The model and a graphical user interface are available from the NOAA Fisheries Stock Assessment Toolbox website:  http://nft.nefsc.noaa.gov/.  An output processor package, r4ss, in R is available for download from CRAN and additional information about the package can be located at https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss.
